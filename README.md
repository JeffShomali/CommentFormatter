### Assembly Comment FormmaterThis small bash program help you to format the comments in an assembly language source file.### Conditions:Comments begin with a ; (semicolon) and end with a newline.The source file will contain only printing characters, spaces, and newlines. It is not necessary to check for invalid input.### Requirements:Lines without comments should not be changed.Entire lines which are comments (begin with ;) should not be changed.Lines containing both code and comments (; preceded by other characters) should have spaces inserted before th comments so all comments begin in the same column, at least 4 columns after the end of the longest code.
